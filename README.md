# SASSIFI-X

* The tailored SASSIFI tool for fault injection into specified GPU kernels.

* Note that different from SASSIFI(https://github.com/NVlabs/sassifi), we made changes to three files: profiler.cu, injector.cu, and test.sh.

* The specified GPU kernel is set by the environment variable KERNEL_NAME in test.sh.
